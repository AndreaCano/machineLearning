    "The SVC always came in last, however, the support vector classifiers has a very low accuracy with this set of data usually below 50. \n",

    "The Voting Classifier however, uses hard voting -which is basically majority rule- between all three classifiers in order to pick the most likely prediction. However, instead of beating the other classifiers with a larger accuracy, it would either level out with Random Classification or Logistic Regression. "
